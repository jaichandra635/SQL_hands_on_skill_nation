Database is a structured collection of data that is organized, managed, and stored
in a way that allows for efficient retrival, manipulation, and querying of information.
it is designed to store and access data. 

In simple terms it is used to store data in tables conisting of rows and columns.
each row represents a specific record, while each column represents a characteristics
of that record

databases are used to store and organize a wide range of information, such as customer
details, product inventory financial trancations, and more.

DATABASE are now divided in three parts

1. DB mode - total 3 types of mode 
           - 1. Open (or) read/write mode - user can access the DB and can use it.
             2. Mount mode - DBA can use DB for maintainance/upgradation/migration
             3. Inactive mode - none can use the DB, where pre requisites are defined

2. DB Logical View
      so, DB Logical View is divided into 
          
        Database ---> TableSpaces ---> Segment ---> Blocks
explanation:
            A database server contains multiple databases inside,
            A database consists of mutliple table spaces
            A table space consists of multiple segments
            A segment consists of multiple blocks
